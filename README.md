# Python FizzBuzz

This repo will have a Python (3.8.1) program that simulates (up to 100) and has tests for FizzBuzz.

FizzBuzz is a game in which players need to:

- Say numbers in ascending order from 1
- On multiples of 3 they must instead say Fizz e.g 9
- On multiples of 5 they must instead say Buzz e.g 25
- On multiples of 3 & 5 they must say FizzBuzz e.g 30
